TTS Rule Set for DeepSeekApp
1. TTS Activation
TTS will only activate when explicitly enabled by the user via a toggle, command, or setting.
TTS will read only the AI’s responses, not the user’s input.
A manual stop option should be available to halt speech output at any time.
2. AI Speech Monitoring
A clear visual indicator (such as a UI animation or status message) will display when the AI is speaking.
Optional auditory cues (e.g., a short chime before or after TTS) can be enabled for additional feedback.
3. Input Handling & Interruptions
Pressing Enter sends the user's query.
Pressing Shift + Enter creates a new line within the input field.
If the user submits a new query while TTS is speaking, the AI should either:
Automatically stop speaking and process the new query.
Queue the new response and allow the user to control when it starts.
4. Conversational Flow & Responsiveness
TTS will always wait for the AI's full response before reading it aloud.
If STT (Speech-to-Text) is enabled in the future, seamless transitions between spoken input and output should be prioritized.
If a response is long, the AI should naturally pause between sentences to mimic human conversation.
5. Refinement & Future Expansion
The rule set will be revised as user feedback is gathered.
Additional features, such as voice tone adjustments or more natural speech synthesis, may be considered to enhance human-like interaction.
